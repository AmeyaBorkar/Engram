# Changelog

All notable changes to Engram are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Once we ship `v1.0.0`, the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); pre-1.0 releases may break the public API on minor version bumps.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project scaffolding: `pyproject.toml` (hatchling build), `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`.
- `ROADMAP.md` — staged plan from foundations through `v1.0`, with cross-cutting standards on speed, quality, security, operability, and SOTA discipline.
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lint (ruff), type (mypy strict), test matrix on Python 3.10–3.13 across Linux/macOS/Windows, smoke benchmark (`engram.bench run noop`), and dependency audit (`pip-audit`).
- `tests/test_smoke.py` — package-level import / instantiation / version checks.
- Empty `Memory` class re-exported from `engram` (implementation forthcoming per `ROADMAP.md` Stage 1+).
- PEP 561 marker (`py.typed`) so consumers receive the package's type information.
- SOTA infrastructure: `benchmarks/SOTA.md` (suites, baselines, algorithmic bets, reproducibility discipline), `benchmarks/SCOREBOARD.md` (running comparison), and placeholder directories `benchmarks/{harness,baselines,suites,runs}/`. Stage DoDs in `ROADMAP.md` now reference scoreboard targets.
- **Stage 1 — Storage and data model**:
  - Core schemas (`engram.schemas`): `Event`, `MemoryItem`, `Embedding`, `ProvenanceLink`, `Cluster`, plus `Level` and `ItemKind` enums. Pydantic v2 models with bounds checks on `weight`/`cohesion` and dim/vector consistency.
  - Time-ordered identifiers (`engram.ids.new_id`): UUIDv7 (RFC 9562) implemented for Python 3.10+ since the stdlib generator only ships in 3.14.
  - `Storage` protocol (`engram.storage.Storage`) — pluggable backend interface; SQLite is the only implementation in Stage 1, Postgres lands in Stage 9.
  - `SqliteStorage` — WAL mode, foreign keys on, per-thread connections, parameterized queries everywhere. CHECK constraints on `weight`, `cohesion`, `level`, `item_kind`, `dim`. Provenance linkage uses `ON DELETE CASCADE` for memory items and `ON DELETE RESTRICT` for events to enforce referential integrity.
  - Migration runner (`engram.storage.migrations`): numbered SQL files with self-recording version inserts, idempotent re-application, atomic-per-migration.
  - `0001_initial.sql` — five tables (`events`, `clusters`, `memory_items`, `embeddings`, `provenance_links`) with indexes on `created_at`, `weight`, `level`, `cluster_id`, `(item_id, item_kind)`, and both directions of provenance.
  - Read-only inspector (`engram.storage.stats`) for tests and manifests.
- **Stage 1 — Benchmark harness scaffold**:
  - `engram.bench` package with CLI (`python -m engram.bench` / `engram-bench` console script) supporting `run <suite> --provider fake --runs-dir <path>`.
  - `Suite` protocol, `SuiteResult` dataclass, `Provider` protocol stub with deterministic `FakeProvider`.
  - `Manifest` writer: captures git commit/dirty, Python version, OS, CPU, RAM (cross-platform), provider hash, dataset version/checksum, aggregate metrics, CIs, per-question scores, and latency histograms. Manifests are JSON-stable (sorted keys, indent=2).
  - `noop` suite — verifies harness end-to-end, runs in CI on every PR.
- **Stage 1 — Tests**: 77 tests covering CRUD, transactions, FK integrity, migration idempotency, `pytest.raises` assertions, plus Hypothesis property tests (provenance never dangles, weights stay bounded, metadata survives arbitrary unicode), fuzz tests against random byte payloads, and opt-in performance tests (`pytest -m slow`) for the DoD numbers (1M inserts < 30 s, last-1k reads < 50 ms). Storage module coverage: 98%.
